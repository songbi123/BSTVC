Description: Providing a "full map" geographical modeling framework designed to precisely capture spatiotemporal differences (spatiotemporal nonstationarity effects) in variable relationships, 
    revealing the spatiotemporal heterogeneous impact mechanisms of multiple explanatory variables. 
    It is concise and user-friendly, meeting the in-depth needs of professionals while lowering the barrier to complex Bayesian modeling, 
    enabling a broader user base to easily apply advanced Bayesian spatiotemporal regression analysis methods to interpret and explain complex spatiotemporal panel data. 
    It is applicable to various fields involving geographical spatial data in natural and human sciences, including but not limited to public health, medical geography, environmental health, economics, and social medicine.
